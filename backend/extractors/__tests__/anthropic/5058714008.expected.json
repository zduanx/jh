  "description": "Claude.ai is Anthropic's flagship consumer product, spanning web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions—and it's growing fast. We're looking for an engineering leader to own the foundational platform that powers all of these surfaces: the shared infrastructure, APIs, tooling, and systems that enable product teams to ship reliably, quickly, and with confidence. \nIn this role, you'll lead the team responsible for reliability, latency, developer velocity, and common components across Claude.ai 's UI surfaces. This includes the backend-for-frontend (BFF) APIs that power our client applications. Your work will directly determine how fast customer, partner, and product teams can innovate—and how stable their experiences are when they ship. This is a highly technical leadership role: you'll stay close to the code, drive architectural decisions, and build the systems that let others move faster. \nThis is a unique opportunity to shape the developer experience and platform foundations for one of the most rapidly evolving AI products in the world. You'll partner closely with product engineering teams, infrastructure, and leadership to ensure Claude.ai scales gracefully as we grow.\n\nResponsibilities:\n- \nLead and grow the UI Platform team, setting technical direction for reliability, performance, and developer experience across all Claude.ai surfaces \n- \nOwn the foundational systems that product teams depend on: shared components, BFF APIs, build and deploy pipelines, observability, and performance infrastructure \n- \nDesign and evolve the API layer that powers Claude.ai 's client applications, ensuring clean abstractions and reliable contracts for product teams \n- \nDrive improvements to developer velocity—reducing friction, improving tooling, and enabling teams to ship features faster and more safely \n- \nEstablish and maintain high standards for latency, reliability, and quality across the platform \n- \nPartner closely with product engineering, infrastructure, and leadership to align platform investments with product priorities \n- \nCreate clarity and direction in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment where priorities shift as Claude.ai evolves \n- \nBuild a culture of technical excellence, collaboration, and continuous improvement within your team",
  "requirements": "Required:\n- \nHave 10+ years of software engineering experience, with significant time spent building platforms, developer tools, or infrastructure for consumer-facing products \n- \nHave 5+ years of engineering leadership experience, including managing and growing teams in high-growth environments \n- \nHave deep expertise in modern web development stacks (React, Next.js, TypeScript) and experience designing APIs that serve frontend applications \n- \nAre passionate about developer experience and have a track record of building tools and systems that make other engineers more productive \n- \nHave strong opinions on reliability, observability, and performance—and know how to operationalize those opinions at scale \n- \nCan balance technical depth with strategic thinking, staying hands-on while also setting long-term direction \n- \nThrive in ambiguity and can create structure and clarity for your team when the path forward isn't obvious \n- \nCommunicate effectively across functions and can build alignment with product, design, and infrastructure partners\n\nPreferred:\n- \nBuilding and scaling platforms for multiple surfaces (web, mobile, desktop, extensions) with shared infrastructure \n- \nDesigning BFF architectures and API patterns that balance flexibility with consistency \n- \nPerformance optimization and latency reduction in consumer-facing applications \n- \nCI/CD, build systems, and deployment automation at scale \n- \nObservability and monitoring systems (metrics, logging, tracing) \n- \nWorking on AI/ML products or in rapidly evolving product environments \n\nThe annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits. Annual Salary: $405,000 - $485,000 USD"
