You understand the importance of seeking in-depth and broad context to build an effective solution. You enjoy building prototypes and short-term solutions to help improve and empower users to innovate on business workflows. You are comfortable contributing to solutions at all technical levels, from scripting to building a custom application. You are able to pivot and iterate quickly on solutions and share learnings with partnering teams in a cross-functional environment.

Qualifications: 2+ years of experience in full-stack development. Comfortable working with: Node.js, Python or Java. React or similar front-end frameworks.

You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $100K - $500K. Inclusion is a Netflix value and we strive to host a meaningful interview experience for all candidates. If you want an accommodation/adjustment for a disability or any other reason during the hiring process, please send a request to your recruiting partner. We are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully.
