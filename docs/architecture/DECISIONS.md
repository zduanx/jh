# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document tracks all major architecture and technology decisions made during the project.

---

## ADR-001: Use FastAPI instead of Django

**Date:** 2024-12-13
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
Need to choose a Python backend framework for building a job tracking application with React frontend.

### Decision
Use **FastAPI** as the backend framework.

### Alternatives Considered
- Django (full-featured web framework)
- Flask (lightweight framework)

### Reasoning
1. API-first design - perfect for React frontend
2. Performance - async support, 10x faster than Django
3. Auto-generated API docs (Swagger UI)
4. Modern Python with type hints
5. Learning value - trendy, interview-friendly

### Consequences
✅ Faster API development, better performance, modern stack
❌ Need to choose ORM separately, implement auth manually

---

## ADR-002: Use Google OAuth with Manual Implementation

**Date:** 2024-12-13
**Status:** Accepted

### Decision
Use Google OAuth 2.0 with manual token validation (google-auth library).

### Alternatives Considered
- Auth0 (3rd party service)
- AWS Cognito
- Custom username/password auth

### Reasoning
1. Learning value - understand OAuth deeply
2. No vendor lock-in
3. Free forever
4. Better interview talking points

### Consequences
✅ Deep OAuth understanding, full control, no costs
❌ More code to write vs Auth0

---

## ADR-003: Use JWT Tokens Instead of Sessions

**Date:** 2024-12-13
**Status:** Accepted

### Decision
Exchange Google OAuth token for our own JWT.

### Alternatives Considered
- Pass Google token directly
- Session-based auth with Redis

### Reasoning
1. Performance - no database lookup per request
2. Stateless - easier horizontal scaling
3. Industry standard for modern APIs
4. Control over expiration times

### Consequences
✅ Fast, scalable, standard for React+API
❌ Cannot revoke before expiration (mitigate with short TTL)

## ADR-004: Deploy Backend to AWS Lambda + API Gateway

**Date:** 2024-12-13
**Status:** Accepted
**Updated:** 2024-12-13 (Changed from EC2 to Lambda)

### Decision
Use **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** for backend deployment (serverless).

### Alternatives Considered
- AWS EC2 (traditional server)
- Elastic Beanstalk
- AWS Lightsail

### Reasoning
1. **Free forever** - 1M requests/month permanent free tier (vs EC2's 12-month limit)
2. **Auto-scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically
3. **Pay per use** - Only pay when API is called (vs EC2 running 24/7)
4. **Modern architecture** - Serverless is industry trend
5. **No server management** - AWS handles everything
6. **FastAPI compatibility** - Works with Mangum adapter
7. **Combined with frontend** - Can serve React + API from Lambda (single deployment)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Truly free for POC (stays free after 12 months)
- ✅ No risk of forgetting to stop EC2 and getting charged
- ✅ Auto-scales (no manual configuration)
- ✅ Modern serverless architecture (great for resume)
- ✅ Can serve both frontend (React) and backend (API) from Lambda
- ✅ API Gateway provides HTTPS automatically

**Negative:**
- ❌ 15-minute timeout (need workaround for long scraping jobs)
- ❌ Cold start latency (~1-2 seconds for first request)
- ❌ More complex debugging (no SSH access)

**Mitigations:**
- For scraping: Use separate solution (EC2 spot instances, ECS, or async queue)
- Cold starts: Acceptable for POC, can add Lambda warming later
- Debugging: Use CloudWatch logs, local testing with SAM

### Implementation Notes
- Use **Mangum** to adapt FastAPI for Lambda
- Use **Lambda Function URLs** or API Gateway for HTTP endpoint
- Serve React build files from Lambda (static files in deployment package)
- Phase 2: Separate long-running scrapers to EC2/ECS

## ADR-005: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (Separate from Backend)

**Date:** 2024-12-13
**Status:** Accepted

### Decision
Deploy React frontend to **Vercel**, separate from Lambda backend.

### Alternatives Considered
- Serve from Lambda (combined deployment)
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- AWS Amplify
- Netlify

### Reasoning
1. **Learn modern deployment** - Experience with popular frontend platform
2. **Separation of concerns** - Frontend and backend scale independently
3. **Zero config** - Connect GitHub, auto-deploy on push
4. **Free forever** - Generous free tier with no time limit
5. **Auto HTTPS** - SSL certificates included
6. **Global CDN** - Fast delivery worldwide
7. **Preview deployments** - Every PR gets a preview URL
8. **Better for learning** - Try different platforms (Vercel + AWS)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Modern frontend deployment workflow
- ✅ Automatic deployments from GitHub
- ✅ Global CDN for fast loading
- ✅ Separation of concerns (frontend/backend independent)
- ✅ Learn both Vercel and AWS
- ✅ Free tier is permanent

**Negative:**
- ❌ Need CORS configuration (backend must allow Vercel domain)
- ❌ Two separate deployments to manage
- ❌ Not "all AWS" (but shows versatility)

**Mitigations:**
- CORS is simple to configure in FastAPI
- Two deployments is standard for modern SPAs
- Shows knowledge of multiple platforms

### Implementation Notes
- Frontend: Push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys
- Backend: Deploy Lambda separately
- CORS: Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Lambda to include Vercel URL
- Environment variables: Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to Lambda/API Gateway URL

## ADR-006: Use REST API (Not GraphQL) for Phase 1

**Date:** 2024-12-13
**Status:** Accepted

### Decision
Use REST API initially, potentially add GraphQL in Phase 2.

### Reasoning
1. Faster to implement for POC
2. Simple data model doesn't need GraphQL flexibility
3. Can add GraphQL later as enhancement (shows migration skills)

### Consequences
✅ Ship faster, standard caching
❌ Less flexible querying (acceptable for Phase 1)
